# ðŸ‘¾ Sophos Teams Alerts ðŸ‘¾

Securely integrate Sophos Central with Microsoft Teams to streamline your cybersecurity alerts!

## ðŸ“œ Description

This project uses the siem.py script provided by Sophos to pull alert data from the security alerts endpoint. The output of the api request is sent to result.txt. My custom powershell script SiemPy.ps1 inputs the json data from result.txt, reformats the json data to send to a Teams webhook url, and finally sends the alert to the Teams channel. 

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. ðŸ“¥ Clone this repository to your production environment.
2. ðŸ›  Modify the `Config.ini` file, replacing `<CLIENT_SECRET>`, `<CLIENT_ID>`, and `<TENANT_ID>` with your credentials.
3. In the SiemPy.ps1 script change the place holder paths to the correct paths for your environment.

4. ðŸ§© Configure an environment variable to store the Teams webhook. Update the Teams Webhook Variable in the SiemPy.ps1 script to your environment variable.

6. ðŸ•° Schedule a recurring task to run the script every minute, ensuring continuous monitoring.
