# ðŸ‘¾ Sophos Teams Alerts ðŸ‘¾

Securely integrate Sophos Central with Microsoft Teams to streamline your cybersecurity alerts!

## ðŸ“œ Description

This project uses the siem.py script provided by Sophos to call the to the security alerts endpoint. The output of the api request is sent to a output file. My custom powershell script SiemPy.ps1 takes the json data output, reformats the json data to send to a Teams webhook url, and finally sends the alert to the Teams channel.

2. ðŸ›  Modify the `Config.ini` file, replacing `<CLIENT_SECRET>`, `<CLIENT_ID>`, and `<TENANT_ID>` with your credentials.
3. ðŸ§© Configure an environment variable in your test environment to store the Teams webhook.
4. ðŸ•° Schedule a recurring task to run the script every minute, ensuring continuous monitoring.
